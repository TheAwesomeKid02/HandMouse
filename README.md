## HandMouse
 Use hand gestures (your thumb and index finger) to move the cursor on your screen.

If you do not know already, your index finger the finger between you thumb and middle finger.

There are several values in the program you can change, such as the threshhold for moving the mouse, the default mouse start position, camera resolution, and the distance between your index finger and thumb for cliucking.

This is a simple mouse controller with <b>TWO</b> functions so far.
<ul>
    <li>Moving your index finger around the screen causes the mouse to move with it</li>
    <li>Don't put your thumb too close to your index finger initially! Moving your thumb closer to your index finger triggers a left mouse click.</li>
</ul>
